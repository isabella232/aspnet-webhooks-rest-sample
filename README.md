# Microsoft Graph ASP.NET Webhooks

Subscribe for webhooks to get notified when your user's data changes so you don't have to poll for changes.

This ASP.NET MVC sample shows how to start getting notifications from Microsoft Graph. [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/) provides a unified API endpoint to access data from the Microsoft cloud.

The following are common tasks that a web application performs with Microsoft Graph webhooks.

* Sign-in your users with their work or school account to get an access token.
* Use the access token to create a webhook [subscription](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/subscription).
* Send back a validation token to confirm the notification URL.
* Listen for notifications from Microsoft Graph.
* Request more information about changed resources using data in the notification.

The previous screenshot shows the app's start page. After the app creates a subscription on behalf of the signed-in user, Microsoft Graph sends a notification to the registered endpoint when events happen in the user's data. The app then reacts to the event.

This sample subscribes to the `me/mailFolders('Inbox')/messages` resource for `created` changes. It gets notified when the user receives a mail message, and then updates a page with information about the message. 

## Prerequisites

To use the Microsoft Graph ASP.NET Webhooks sample, you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2015 installed on your development computer. 

* A [work or school account](http://dev.office.com/devprogram).

* The application ID and key from the application that you [register on the Azure Portal](#register-the-app).

* A public HTTPS endpoint to receive and send HTTP requests. You can host this on Microsoft Azure or another service, or you can [use ngrok](#ngrok) or a similar tool while testing.

### Register the app

This app uses the v1.0 Azure AD endpoint, so you'll register it in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in to the portal using your work or school account.

2. If you have multiple tenants associated with your account, click your account name in the upper-right corner and choose the target tenant.

3. Choose **Azure Active Directory** in the left-hand navigation pane.

4. Click **App registrations** and choose **Add**.

5. Enter a friendly name for the application.

6. Choose 'Web app/API' as the **Application Type** and enter *https://localhost:44300/* for the Sign-on URL. Click **Create**.

7. Choose your new application from the list of registered applications.

8. Click **Settings**, and then choose **Properties**. Copy and store the Application ID value.

9. Configure Permissions for your application:  
  a. In the **Settings** pane, choose **Required permissions**.
  
  b. Click **Add** and then choose **Select an API**, choose **Microsoft Graph**, and then click **Select**.
  
  c. For **Select Permissions**, scroll down to **Delegated Permissions** and choose **Read user mail**.
  
  d. Click **Select** and then click **Done**.

10. In the **Settings** pane, choose **Keys**. Enter a description, choose a duration for the key, and click **Save**.

11. **Important**: Copy the key value--this is your app's secret. You won't be able to access this value again after you leave this pane.

You'll use the application ID and secret to configure the app in Visual Studio.

### Set up the ngrok proxy (optional) 
You must expose a public HTTPS endpoint to create a subscription and receive notifications from Microsoft Graph. While testing, you can use ngrok to temporarily allow messages from Microsoft Graph to tunnel to a *localhost* port on your computer. 

You can use the ngrok web interface (*http://127.0.0.1:4040*) to inspect the HTTP traffic that passes through the tunnel. To learn more about using ngrok, see the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/).  

1. In Solution Explorer, select the **GraphWebhooks** project.

1. Copy the **URL** port number from the **Properties** window. If the **Properties** window isn't showing, choose **View > Properties Window**.

1. [Download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) for Windows.  

1. Unzip the package and run ngrok.exe.

1. Replace the two *\<port-number\>* placeholder values in the following command with the port number you copied, and then run the command in the ngrok console.

   ```
ngrok http <port-number> -host-header=localhost:<port-number>
   ```

	![Example command to run in the ngrok console](readme-images/ngrok1.PNG)

1. Copy the HTTPS URL that's shown in the console. You'll use this to configure your notification URL in the sample.

   >Keep the console open while testing. If you close it, the tunnel also closes and you'll need to generate a new URL and update the sample.

See [Hosting without a tunnel](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-Nodejs-Webhooks/wiki/Hosting-the-sample-without-a-tunnel) and [Why do I have to use a tunnel?](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-Nodejs-Webhooks/wiki/Why-do-I-have-to-use-a-tunnel) for more information.


## Configure and run the sample

1. Expose a public HTTPS notification endpoint. It can run on a service such as Microsoft Azure, or you can create a proxy web server by [using ngrok](#ngrok) or a similar tool.

1. Open **GraphWebhooks.sln** in the sample files. 

   >You may be prompted to trust certificates for localhost.

1. In Solution Explorer, open the **Web.config** file in the root directory of the project.  
   a. For the **ClientId** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_APP_ID* with the application ID of your registered Azure application.  
 
   b. For the **ClientSecret** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_SECRET* with the key of your registered Azure application.  

   c. For the **NotificationUrl** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_URL* with the HTTPS URL. Keep the */notification/listen* portion. If you're using ngrok, use the HTTPS URL that you copied. The value will look something like this:

   ```xml
<add key="ida:NotificationUrl" value="https://0f6fd138.ngrok.io/notification/listen" />
   ```

1. Make sure that the ngrok console is still running, then press F5 to build and run the solution in debug mode. 


### Use the app
 
1. Sign in with your work or school account. 

1. Consent to the **Read your mail** and **Sign you in and read your profile** permissions. 
    
   If you don't see the **Read your mail** permission, choose **Cancel** and then add the **Read user mail** permission to the app in the Azure Portal. See the [Register the app](#register-the-app) section for instructions.

1. Choose the **Create subscription** button. The **Subscription** page loads with information about the subscription.

	![App page showing properties of the new subscription](readme-images/Page2.PNG)
	
1. Choose the **Watch for notifications** button.

1. Send an email to your Office 365 account. The **Notification** page displays some message properties. It may take several seconds for the page to update.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|:------|:------|
| You get a 403 Forbidden response when you attempt to create a subscription. | Make sure that your app registration includes the **Read user mail** delegated permission for Microsoft Graph (as described in the [Register the app](#register-the-app) section). This permission must be set before your user gives consent. Otherwise you'll need to register a new app, or remove the app for the user at [https://myapps.microsoft.com/](https://myapps.microsoft.com/). |  
| The client does not receive notifications. | If you're using ngrok, you can use the web interface (http://127.0.0.1:4040) to see whether the notification is being received. If you're not using ngrok, monitor the network traffic using the tools your hosting service provides, or try using ngrok.<br />If Microsoft Graph is not sending notifications, please open a [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/MicrosoftGraph) issue tagged *[MicrosoftGraph]*. Include the subscription ID, the time it was created, and the correlation ID from the response (if you have it).<br /><br />Known issue: Occasionally the notification is received, and the retrieved message is sent to NotificationService, but the SignalR client in this sample does not update. When this happens, it's usually the first notification after the subscription is created. |
| You're using ngrok and get a *Subscription validation request timed out* response. | Make sure that you used your project's HTTP port for the tunnel (not HTTPS). |
| The app opens to a *Server Error in '/' Application. The resource cannot be found.* browser page. | Make sure that a CSHTML view file isn't the active tab when you run the app from Visual Studio. |
